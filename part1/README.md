# Simulating active monocular depth estimation

## Setting up the scene
The scene was set up in blender and images were captured as per [this blog](https://dragly.org/2020/06/05/structured-light-part-1/).

## To run

 - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 - Run `python script.py`.

This will generate a `out.xyz` file which can be viewed with a visualization tool such as [Ovito](https://www.ovito.org/).
